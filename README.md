#NCAA Top 25 Games Scraper
Mainly just a test using Cheerio. Wanted to grab the top 25 games and do something with it. Currently it just displays the games on a page. 

##Start using the project
`npm install`

`npm start`

Will load up on port 8181. Head to the URL localhost:8181/scrape and if everything goes correctly, you should see the games.
